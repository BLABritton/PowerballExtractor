# PowerballExtractor

## Client requested a program they could run whenever to:

  scrape numbers from www.ohiolottery.com to find out how many times x number appears on each page not including the red numbers

## Requested the data presented like so:

  "If it doesnt appear then it would say 0 for that number, each number that appears once would be next to the number 1 and so on and so forth"
  
## So my solution was:

  Send the script to the client as an .exe so he didn't need python to use it, and could use it himself whenever.
  
  To scrape the website with selenium as there were elements you had to click to access the numbers.
  
  Present the data in the application command line in two ways, once sorted by most common numbers high to low, and then by number 0 to greatest with how many     times it appears next to it.
  
  Also export each pages results to seperate csv files, sorted by most common numbers high to low.
  
## What the client said:

  "You did an excellent job, it actually came out way better than I had expected."
